D&D 5th edition damage baselines with basic class and loadout.
These baselines are a blend of resource consumption; from zero-cost to single-use abilities. Recommended for visual and
simple comparisons only, due to breadth of info, without much nuance. Sometimes, survey comparison is best.

Used courtesy of u/Asinus, via r/DnD, with minor syntax fix for moon druids.
